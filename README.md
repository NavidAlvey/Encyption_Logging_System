# Encryption Logging System
## Project Overview
This system allows users to:
- Set a passkey for encrypting and decrypting messages.
- Log and review command history.
- Simulate a basic memory system with read and write operations.
The application consists of modular Java classes and processes that work together to perform these tasks.
The main driver, `DriverProgram.java`, manages the system, providing a menu interface for user interactions.

## Files and Functionality
### Driver.java and DriverProgram.java
- Main driver files that control the flow of the application.
- Initializes and manages the EncryptionProgram, Logger, and MainMemory processes using ProcessBuilder. Displays a command menu for user input and handles inter-process communication.
### EncryptionProgram.java
- Handles encryption and decryption of messages.
- Accepts a passkey, encrypts or decrypts messages based on the passkey using a shift-based algorithm, and returns results.
### Logger.java
- Logs each command and action performed within the system.
- Records commands in log.txt with timestamps, providing a console display and an audit trail.
### MainMemory.java
- Simulates a basic memory read/write system.
- Allows read and write commands to manage a single memory location.
### CPU.java
- Intended to manage processing and resource allocation tasks.
- Coordinates & performs central processing tasks.
### tempCodeRunnerFile.java
- Placeholder file often generated by IDEs during debugging.

## Example Commands
When running the program, you will have access to the following commands:

- `password` - Set or select a password for encryption/decryption.
- `encrypt` - Encrypt a string using the current passkey.
- `decrypt` - Decrypt a string using the current passkey.
- `history` - Display the history of previously entered passwords.
- `quit` - Quit the program and close all processes.

## Usage:
- Start the program by running `Driver.java`.
- Enter `password` to set a passkey for encryption and decryption.
- Use `encrypt` or `decrypt` commands to transform messages.
- View past passkeys or encrypted/decrypted messages in `history`.
- Type `quit` to end the session.
